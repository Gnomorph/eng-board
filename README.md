# Eng Board

## Synopsis
A whiteboard inspired by the ease of use of pen and paper.  This is a personal project that started as a replacement for scratch paper while tutoring. However, it is a great tool for making quick notes, sketching out ideas and any basic, free-form (temporary) drawing.

## Usage
The whiteboard works best on an iPad with Apple Pencil or a Surface Pro with Surface Pen.

### iPad
Drawing should work easily with an Apple Pencil. The eraser gesture is accessed by touching one finger to the lower right corner of the screen and using another finger to erase.
Most touch gestures are ignored to prevent stray clicks and drawing.

### Surface Pro
Drawing should work easily with a Surface Pen. The eraser gesture is accessed by using the Surface Pen's eraser.
Most touch gestures are ignored to prevent stray clicks and drawing.
