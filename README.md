# Eng Board
A whiteboard inspired by the ease of use of pen and paper.  This is a personal project that started as a replacement for scratch paper while tutoring. However, it is a great tool for making quick notes, sketching out ideas and any basic, free-form (temporary) drawing.


The drawing feature of Eng Board is intend to be used with a tablet such as:
* iPad with Apple Pencil
* Surface Pro with Surface Pen
* Desktop with Wacom Tablet

Almost any device with a browser should be able to view realtime drawings in public rooms.

### Demo
> NOTE: Please see the section for your platform to check for any limitations, installation instructions, or bugs.

## Desktop
Most devices with a mouse or Wacom tablet should work without issue. Firefox and Chromium based browsers have been tested on Windows and Linux.
*  **Draw:** Left Click
*  **Erase:** Right Click

## Mobile (touch devices)
> NOTE: Touch drawing is disabled by design. Mobile devices without a pen or mouse cannot draw.

Mobile devices are great for viewing drawings that others are making. They can also manipulate the drawing history with undo/redo, as well as clear the screen.

## iPad with Apple Pencil
> NOTE: The Magic Eraser is not working currently. The issue will be worked on soon.

Drawing with the Surface Pen is seamless and intuitive.
*  **Draw:** Pencil Tip
*  **Erase:** Magic Eraser - One finger touches the bottom right corner, and a second finger becomes an eraser.

### iOS bugs
* on first load, the pen will scroll the window, and only make short marks. a temporary work-around is to open and close the debug menu


## Surface Pro with Surface Pen
> NOTE: Recent changes have affected Surface Pen compatability. The issue will be worked on soon.

When enabled and working, drawing with the Surface Pen is seamless and intuitive.
*  **Draw:** Pen Tip
*  **Erase:** Pen Eraser
